  There are two scoreboards.

- Gameboard
  Once you click the new game, at the top, there is a timer and a recorder to record steps.
  Your final score will be calculated based on the time, steps you used to finish the game,
  your total undo steps and game complexity.
  The formula is: final score = 500 -0.15 * mTimeLeftInMillis / 1000 - 0.25 * board.numStep - 3 * numUndo - 10 * complexity, rounded to an integer.
- AutoSave
  The game status will be automatically saved for each time you swap a tile.
- Undo
  At the top, there is also an undo button. If in setting you choose to undo 3 steps, you can only undo 3 steps at most.

- SETTING
  In setting, you can choose the game difficulty(easy or hard) with default value easy, and the bullet type(brown one and the blue one) with the default value brown,
  if you choose hard, the speed of enemy crafts and enemy bullets moving is faster than that of easy mode, and if you choose blue bullet, the image of bullet shot by AirCrafts will change correspondingly.
